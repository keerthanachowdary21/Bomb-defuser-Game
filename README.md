This HTML document creates a timer with a bomb image and an input field for defusing. 
It uses Bootstrap for styling and includes JavaScript to handle the countdown and user input.
The timer starts at 10 seconds and counts down each second until either reaching zero (displaying "BOOM") or
being defused by typing "java" into the input field before time runs out.
